/*
    Create classes Cat, Dog, and Bird
    Each of these classes will accept the parameters name and sex and will store those values as properties.
For each class, create the method speak.

    For an instance of Cat, speak returns "name says meow!",
    For an instance of Dog, speak returns "name says woof!"
    For an instance of Bird, speak returns conditional output. If the instance of Bird is male, speak returns "It's me! name, the parrot!". If it is not male, speak returns "name says squawk!".
